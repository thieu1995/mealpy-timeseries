# Hyper-parameter tuning using Mealpy of:

1. MLP
2. SVR (SVM) 


# Notes: Run too slow

1. MLP: Can't complain, it takes time to train a single neural network


2. SVR: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47460201/scikit-learn-svr-runs-very-long
    + How did I know it took too long with SVR, when there is no print out option in SVR model like MLP.
    + Set up print() in generate_trained_model() function of timseries_svr.py



# Environments

```code 

Open terminal in windows:

    python -m venv pve_mealpy_test
    pve_mealpy_test\Scripts\activate.bat
    pip install -r requirements.txt
